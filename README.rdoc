Problems, HW5

Works fine.

What I did HW5
- Added relationships between the three different models and controllers present. Notes can be created, a note belongs to a
certain notebook, a notebook belongs to a certain user.
Problems, HW4

The attribute accessible option does not work on rails 4
Problems, HW2

- None
Problems from initial setup

- Needed to run 'bundle update' each time the gemfile was changed before heroku would accept the push.
- Needed to add the gem 'rails_12factor' to gemfile for heroku to be able to deploy the app.
- Needed to add the ruby version to the app too for heroku.
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running.
